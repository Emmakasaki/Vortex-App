## Description

Vortex App is a personal app i'm currently creating mostly for myself, but may make it better suited for use for others as well. I'm not 100% sure what will be in this app but my first idea for it is a game tracker so that I/you can log games you're currently playing and have the achievements tracked and log the hours it took you to beat as well as let you mark it as completed, incompleted, or 100%'d. If you have any other suggestions feel free to contact me and suggest them :D
