# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, I appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly. To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Contact me on discord @emmakasaki with the subject line: "Security Vulnerability Report".
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce and any potential impact.
4. Our security team will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work with you to validate and address the issue.
5. Once the vulnerability is resolved, I will publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired) and release a security advisory.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all versions of our project.

## Supported Versions

I will accept vulnerability reports for the latest stable release and the previous major version.

## Disclosure Timeline

- I aim to respond to vulnerability reports within 48 hours.
- I will work with you to address the issue and provide regular updates on the progress.
- Once the vulnerability is resolved, I will coordinate the release of a security advisory.

## Safe Harbor

I consider security research activities conducted in a responsible manner as "authorized" and will not initiate legal action against you if you:

- Comply with our vulnerability disclosure policy.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability without our prior consent.
